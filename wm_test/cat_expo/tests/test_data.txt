    "description": "If you're looking for a cat that isn't into impressive displays of athleticism,
    the Persian might be the perfect breed for you. These cats love to lounge,
    particularly after they reach adulthood. Perhaps that's why some people call them furniture with fur.
    Don't be fooled by this reputation, though. These cats do exhibit a playful streak,
    particularly when their people are interested in joining the fun."
